## The Modern Story
Every time you stream a 4K video, your phone downloads it in tiny pieces that take different routes across the internet, then reassemble perfectly in real-time. 5G networks just broke speed records again — 20 gigabits per second in trials.

But this "revolutionary" packet-switching technology that makes 5G possible? It was invented in 1962 by a RAND Corporation engineer who was trying to build a communications system that could survive nuclear war.

## ROOT: Going Back to 1962

Paul Baran was thinking about nuclear war. It was 1962, the Cold War was at its peak, and the U.S. military needed communications that could survive Soviet attacks.

Traditional phone networks used circuit-switching — dedicated lines between callers. Destroy one switching center, and huge chunks of the network went dark.

Baran's radical solution: break messages into small packets and send them through any available path. If some packets get destroyed, send more. If a route gets blocked, the packets find another way.

He called it "distributed communications." The Pentagon called it too risky and shelved the research.

Eleven years later, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn picked up where Baran left off, developing TCP/IP. By the 1990s, packet-switching had become the foundation of the global internet.

## Did You Know
Paul Baran's 1962 packet-switching concept was designed to withstand nuclear attacks. Today, that same technology routes your Netflix streams, delivers your messages, and enables your video calls. Every data packet traveling through 5G networks follows routing principles Baran invented 59 years ago.

## Why It Matters Today
Every swipe, tap, and click you make sends data through packet-switched networks. That 4K video reaches your phone by breaking into thousands of tiny packets, each finding its own route across the internet, then reassembling in perfect order.

Understanding packet-switching helps you grasp why the internet is so resilient — and why it sometimes isn't. When your connection slows down, it's often because packets are taking longer routes around congested network nodes, just as Baran designed them to do around destroyed ones.

The nuclear-proof network of 1962 became the foundation for global connectivity. Today's 5G "breakthrough" is actually the latest evolution of a 60-year-old defensive strategy that prioritized survival over speed.
