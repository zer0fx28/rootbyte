## The Modern Story

Right now, you are almost certainly connected to WiFi. Your phone. Your laptop. Maybe your TV, your thermostat, your doorbell. WiFi is so ubiquitous it's invisible — like air. By 2026, there are over 5 billion WiFi-enabled devices on the planet.

Almost none of their owners know who invented it. Or that those inventors were looking for something else entirely.

## ROOT: Going Back to 1992

In the late 1980s, a team of engineers and physicists at Australia's government research agency — the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) — were trying to detect **exploding mini black holes**.

Stephen Hawking had theorized that tiny black holes created at the Big Bang might still be evaporating today, releasing radio waves as they vanished. CSIRO physicist John O'Sullivan and his team built radio receivers to detect them.

They never found the black holes. What they found was a math problem: radio waves bounce off walls in buildings, creating multipath interference that scrambles signals. O'Sullivan solved that problem using a technique called **inverse Fourier transform** to reconstruct the original clean signal from the echoes.

In 1992, the team patented this approach. Applied to wireless data transmission, it solved the indoor interference problem that had made high-speed wireless communication indoors essentially impossible.

That patent became the core of **802.11** — the IEEE standard adopted in 1999 that you know as WiFi.

**The timeline:**
- **1987** — O'Sullivan's team begins radio astronomy research hunting for black holes
- **1992** — CSIRO patents the multipath interference solution
- **1999** — IEEE adopts 802.11b standard globally; WiFi era begins
- **2009** — U.S. courts rule CSIRO's patent is valid; licensing negotiations begin
- **2012** — After suing Intel, Dell, HP, T-Mobile, AT&T, and others, CSIRO collects **$430 million USD** in royalties
- **2026** — 5+ billion devices use the same underlying math from that 1992 patent

## Did You Know

Intel, Dell, HP, T-Mobile, AT&T, and 11 other major companies were all sued by Australia's CSIRO for using their WiFi patent without licensing it. Every single one settled. The country that invented WiFi had to sue Silicon Valley to get credit — and money — for it.

## Why It Matters Today

The WiFi story is a perfect case study in how technology's history gets rewritten. The public narrative says WiFi was invented in America, by the tech industry, for the internet. The actual history says it was invented in Australia, by a government science agency, while hunting for evaporating black holes.

The gap between invention and credit is sometimes a continent wide.

## FUTURE: 6G, Terahertz Waves, and Wireless That Powers You

> ⚠️ This section is speculative — based on active research, standardization processes, and technology roadmaps. Not yet reality.

O'Sullivan's team solved the multipath problem that unlocked WiFi. The next generation of engineers are solving the bandwidth problem — and several even stranger ones.

### 6G — 100x Faster, Starting 2030
5G networks reached mainstream deployment around 2023. The global race for **6G** is already underway — with South Korea, China, Japan, the EU, and the US all funding dedicated 6G programs. Target: commercial deployment by 2030.

6G will use **terahertz (THz) frequencies** — waves so high-frequency they can carry 1 terabit per second of data. That's fast enough to download every movie ever made in about 3 seconds.

The challenge: terahertz waves don't travel through walls or rain. Engineers are literally solving the same multipath problem O'Sullivan solved — at 100x the frequency.

### Wireless Power — The Cable-Free Future
Research teams at MIT, ETH Zurich, and Samsung's Advanced Institute of Technology are developing **ambient RF energy harvesting** — the ability for small, low-power devices to extract enough energy from ordinary WiFi and cellular signals around them to operate indefinitely.

Early prototypes can power a basic temperature sensor or RFID chip from ambient 5G signals alone. By 2032–2035, earbuds, medical sensors, and smart home devices may ship with "no charging required" as a feature.

**The thread from 1992 to 2035:** John O'Sullivan solved interference to transmit data wirelessly. The next breakthrough will transmit *power* wirelessly. Same electromagnetic spectrum. Same physics. Different century.
