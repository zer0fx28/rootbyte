## The Modern Story
Every time you tap your phone screen, you're using technology that Apple didn't invent,
didn't fund, and didn't discover. When Steve Jobs held up the first iPhone in 2007 and
called multi-touch "revolutionary," he wasn't wrong about its impact. He was wrong about
its origin.

## ROOT: Going Back to 1965
E.A. Johnson was an engineer at the Royal Radar Establishment in Malvern, England.
In 1965, he published a paper describing a touch screen that worked by detecting the
electrical properties of a human finger — the exact principle called capacitive sensing.

He demonstrated it. He wrote about it. He had working prototypes used for air traffic
control systems by the late 1960s.

He never patented it commercially. He received no royalties. His name appears in
almost zero mainstream tech history coverage.

## Did You Know
Between E.A. Johnson's 1965 paper and the 2007 iPhone launch — 42 years passed.
Every capacitive touchscreen made in those 42 years, and every one made since,
operates on the same physics Johnson published in a UK defense research journal.

## Why It Matters Today
The story of touchscreen invention is the story of how technology actually spreads:
slowly, obscurely, through defense research and academic papers that nobody reads,
until a company with great marketing arrives and calls it revolutionary.

Johnson's work is worth knowing not to diminish Apple, but to understand that
the real inventors of our world often worked in total obscurity — and that the
gap between "invented" and "successful product" can be measured in decades.
