WebStorm + Claude Code Setup Guide
Complete developer setup for building and shipping
KreativLoops · Version 1.0 · February 2026

1. Before You Start
You need 3 things installed on your Windows machine before anything else.

Required Software
	•	Node.js v20+ — Download from nodejs.org — choose the LTS version. This powers Claude Code and your build scripts.
	•	Git — Download from git-scm.com. Required for version control and Vercel deployment.
	•	WebStorm — Your IDE. Available at jetbrains.com/webstorm — student/freelancer license available.

✅
Quick Check
Open Command Prompt and run: node --version && git --version
Both should return version numbers. If not, install them first.

Your Subscription
Claude Code works with your existing Claude.ai Pro or Max subscription — no extra billing needed.
	•	Claude Pro — Works. Good for moderate daily use.
	•	Claude Max — Recommended for heavy daily content creation.
	•	Anthropic Console — API key billing — works but can get expensive with heavy use. Pro/Max is safer.

2. Install Claude Code
Anthropic now has a native installer — no Node.js path issues, no sudo problems.

Windows Installation
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex

Then verify it worked:
claude --version
claude doctor

💡  If claude doctor shows PATH warnings
Run: echo $env:PATH in PowerShell and check that %USERPROFILE%\.local\bin appears. If not, restart your terminal after installation — the installer modifies your PATH but your current session hasn't reloaded it yet.

Authenticate
First time you run claude, it opens your browser to authenticate:
claude
Log in with your Claude.ai account. Done — credentials are saved permanently.

3. Set Up the RootByte Project

Step 1 — Create Your Project Folder
Choose where you want the project. Recommended: your Documents folder.
mkdir C:\Users\YourName\Documents\rootbyte
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\rootbyte

Step 2 — Copy the Project Files
Paste all the project files (index.html, CLAUDE.md, package.json, scripts/, src/) into this folder.
Your folder structure should look like this:
rootbyte/
  CLAUDE.md          ← Claude Code reads this first
  package.json
  .env.example       ← copy to .env and add your keys
  .gitignore
  src/
    index.html       ← the main website
    content/
      articles/      ← .md files, one per article
      trending.json  ← live trending data
  scripts/
    new-article.js
    fetch-trending.js

Step 3 — Set Up Environment Variables
Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your API keys:
copy .env.example .env
Open .env in WebStorm and fill in:
NEWS_API_KEY=your_key_from_newsapi.org
BREVO_API_KEY=your_key_from_brevo.com
🔑  Where to get free API keys
NewsAPI.org: Sign up free → 100 requests/day. Use for the trending section.
Brevo.com: Sign up free → 300 emails/day. Use for the newsletter.

Step 4 — Open in WebStorm
Open WebStorm → File → Open → select your rootbyte folder.
WebStorm will auto-detect the project structure. You should see the file tree on the left.

Step 5 — Set Up Git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial RootByte project setup"

Then create a GitHub repo and push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/rootbyte.git
git push -u origin main

4. Configure WebStorm for Claude Code

Open the Built-in Terminal
WebStorm has a built-in terminal at the bottom. This is where you run Claude Code.
Keyboard shortcut: Alt + F12 (Windows) or use View → Tool Windows → Terminal.

Add Claude Code to External Tools (Optional but useful)
File → Settings → Tools → External Tools → Click + to add:
	•	Name: Claude Code
	•	Program: claude
	•	Arguments: (leave blank)
	•	Working directory: $ProjectFileDir$
Now you can launch Claude Code from the Tools menu directly inside WebStorm.

⚡  Power Tip: Run Claude Code in the Terminal Panel
Keep WebStorm open with your files on the left, and Claude Code running in the bottom terminal panel. You can edit code manually AND ask Claude Code to make changes — both at the same time. Claude Code will see your changes in real time.

5. Daily Content Workflow
This is how you create and publish a new article. Takes 10-15 minutes once you have the routine.

In the WebStorm Terminal, start Claude Code:
claude

Tell Claude Code what to do:
Type in natural language — Claude Code reads your CLAUDE.md and knows the project:

What you say
What Claude Code does
"new article about the history of WiFi"
Creates scaffolded .md file, researches ROOT connection, fills in content
"fetch trending tech news"
Runs fetch-trending.js, updates trending.json, filters bad content
"update the tomorrow teaser to XRP article"
Edits index.html tomorrow box content directly
"add a new DYK card about the first hard drive"
Creates DYK JSON entry, updates the reel deck in TikTok mode
"deploy to Vercel"
Commits changes, pushes to GitHub, triggers Vercel auto-deploy


6. Deploy to Vercel (Free)

One-time Setup
	•	Go to vercel.com and sign up with your GitHub account
	•	Click "Add New Project" → Import your rootbyte GitHub repo
	•	Framework preset: Other (it's a static site)
	•	Root directory: src
	•	Click Deploy — Vercel will give you a URL like rootbyte.vercel.app
	•	Add your custom domain in Settings → Domains (optional)

Every Deploy After That
Just push to GitHub and Vercel deploys automatically:
git add .
git commit -m "New article: History of WiFi"
git push
Or tell Claude Code: "deploy to Vercel" and it does all three commands.

🚀  Vercel Free Tier
Handles millions of requests per month for free. Your static HTML loads in under 200ms globally via Vercel's CDN. This speed directly affects your AdSense RPM — faster sites earn more per thousand pageviews.

7. AdSense Setup

Before Applying
Google checks these things before approval. Have all of them ready:
	•	15-20 published articles (800-1,200 words each)
	•	About page — explain what RootByte is and who runs it
	•	Privacy Policy page — use privacypolicygenerator.info (free)
	•	Contact page — your email or a contact form
	•	Advertise page — rate card for direct sponsors
	•	Domain age — 3-6 months preferred (not required but helps)

Apply at
adsense.google.com → Sign up → Add your site URL
Google places a verification code in your site head. Claude Code will add it for you:
"add the AdSense verification meta tag: ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX"

Ad Slot Positions (already in index.html)
	•	Leaderboard (728×90) — above the fold, after masthead
	•	In-feed (300×250 responsive) — between articles in the grid
	•	Sidebar #1 (300×250) — top of sidebar, below newsletter
	•	Sidebar #2 (300×250) — below On This Day widget

Block Bad Ads
In AdSense Dashboard → Blocking Controls → Content → Block by category:
	•	Dangerous products and services
	•	Get rich quick schemes
	•	Gambling
	•	Adult
	•	Weight loss programs
	•	Dating and personals
These match the CLEAN ADS POLICY built into your CLAUDE.md.

9. Claude Code Quick Reference
Useful commands to run in the WebStorm terminal with Claude Code active:

Content Commands
"new article about [topic]"
"fetch trending tech news and update the ticker"
"write a DYK card about [fact]"
"update tomorrow's teaser to [story title]"

🧠  CLAUDE.md is your secret weapon
The CLAUDE.md file in your project root is read by Claude Code automatically on every session. It contains your entire site's rules, article format, ad policy, and workflow. You never have to re-explain anything. When you onboard this to Claude Code, it already knows everything about RootByte.
